# Professional Self-Assessment
## Overview of Coursework Throughout the Program
Throughout my enrollment in the computer science program, I was able to obtain a perspective and understanding of the field of
computer science. Though it was a struggle at times and I wanted to quit, I stuck with it and followed it to the end. This course
has not been short in terms of obstacles and stress. However, looking back on it, I am very glad to have taken it and saw it through
to the end. This course has given me the knowledge and ability to work with a development team (fellow students) and learn what it
means and what it takes to participate in a team and work together. We were able to provide feedback to each other and use that to
further develop our project. There were several courses where we were asked, after completing a project, to create a report for 
stakeholders in which we explained the project, the requirements of the project, if the requirements were met, and how the development
of the project met the requirements. This program has taught me how to create databases in various coding languages and applications 
including but not limited to Java, MongoDB, C++, Eclipse, Terminal, & Android App Studio. We were able to develop algorithms for app 
development (CS-360), database development that translates to visual presentation with HTML and utilizes search filters (CS-340), 
and transmitting light sequences in Morse Code onto a physical entity to transmit those codes as well as detect the room temperature
(CS-350). It was through classes such as CS-405 and IT-380 that we were able to learn and understand the importance of security in
systems and databases and how to detect vulnerabilities, patch them, and implement a more secure system. Security in programs and 
databases is crucial, especially in today's society where the number of cyberattacks is on the rise. 
## Span of CS-499 and the Artifacts
This class has awarded the opportunity to choose 1-3 artifacts from previous courses and enhance them from what they once were to a 
better demonstation of the effectiveness of the computer science program as a whole. These artifacts had to fit into three categories:
software design & engineering, algorithms and data structures, & databases. The artifacts that I have chosen were the CS-330
3-2 Assignment & the final project from CS-360. 
### Artifact 1: CS-330 Assignment 3-2
The 3-2 Assignment from CS-330 (Computational Graphics & Visualization) was fairly early on in the course and was completed before the
introduction of light sources, shaders, and textures. Within this assignment, the student was asked to utilize Microsoft Visual Studio 
to recreate a given image in terms of shape, scale, translation, and rotation. I had selected this artifact to satisfy the software 
design and engineering category. With the knowledge obtained from the CS-330 class, I was able to implement the coding in order to 
initialize the functions for lighting, shaders, and textures. Once that code was introduced I was able to implement a light source 
in the scene, textures for all shapes, as well as shading properties for each shape in relation to the added light source. 
### Artifact 2: CS-360 Weight Tracking App
The final project for CS-360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming) was for the student to develop an app utilizing Android App
Studio. I had chosen to create a weight tracking app that is able to utilize a login screen that is able to screen a user's input
& determine whether or not the login was successful, unsuccessful, or the user needed to create a new account in order to utilize 
the app. I utilized this artifact for the second category, algorithms and date structures. Although I was unsuccessful in the CS-360
course in carrying out this task, the opportunity to revisit this project allowed me to develop the functionality in completing this
task. I was also able to develop the functionality to the app buttons that I was unsuccessful in accomplishing in the original class.
### Artifact 3: CS: 360 Weight Tracking App
I utilized the same project as my third artifact because I wanted to enhance more to show how much I had developed since taking the
original class. I had selected this artifact to satisfy the databases category. On top of developing an algorithm for the login, I
also wanted to enhance the database of the app in order to have the function to receive input, store it, delete it, and recognize 
when the user has met their designated goal weight. I was able to successfully accomplish this assignment and recognize my shortcomings
in the original class. With the implementation of DOA (Data Access Object) files for specific aspects of the database, I was able to
organize the database and access the functionality behind these DAO files in the assigned Java classes in order to carry out the callbacks
and logic within the database to carry out CRUD tasks. 
## Conclusion
This class has allowed me to revisit some artifacts from previous courses and have the opportunity to enhance them to demonstate skills
I have developed throughout my enrollment in the computer science program. Although being successful in the enhancements, the artifacts
still need further work to address some bug issues relating to the launch process found along that way. This acknowledgement shows a 
demonstration is accountability, honesty, and the recognition of room for improvement. I will continue to further my education in 
computer science nd be able to become a better software engineer with thanks to my enrollment in this program.
